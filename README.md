# This code performs basic manipulation of data in the titanic_data.csv file
# The first command (lines 11-13) renames some columns, giving them less technical names
# Second command (lines 16-17) selects columns of interest (survived, class, sex, age, fare), and put them in a new file
# Third command (lines 20-24) calculates the average age of male and female passengers, after removing passengers whose ages are listed as NA
# Fourth command (lines 29-34) calculates the average ticket cost per class, after removing passengers whose ages are listed as NA
# Fifth command (lines 42-44) calculates number of male and female passengers per class
# Sixth command (lines 47-54) displays average ticket cost per class, by male and female passenger, using a pivot table
# Seventh command begins the data plotting; a basic plot of age by fare is calculated with line 63
# Commands on lines 66-79 creates a better fit, color coded plot
# GGplot is installed and the fare charted by sex and age is plotted
# GGplot is used to plot fare by age and survival
# GGplot is used to plot fare by sex and survival
# Vegan and corrplot are installed to make a biplot
# Final command (lines 140-145) codes for a biplot of all of our important variables.
